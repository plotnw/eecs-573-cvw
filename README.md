Source code of our modifications to CVW for our "Impossible Hardware Trojan" project

## Usage Notes
Using Ubuntu 22.04
1) if you want to use not /opt/riscv as $RISCV
    places to change: bin/wally-tool-chain-install.sh, setup.sh
    search for "opt" in both and replace accordingly. alternatively, just do the $RISCV setting externally of bin/wally-tool-chain-install.sh and just comment those out
2) run setup.sh
    change questsim path to wherever it was installed to
    make sure to source the script, not bash, since latter wont set variables
3) dont use the custom gcc-13 pull, riscv-gnu-toolchain uses gcc13 by default on recent branch
    just comment out the pull and remove the extra arg in ./configure
4) remove zlibc from install of packages before verilator, it isnt needed and doesnt exist in ubuntu repos anymore
5) building sail-riscv didn't work
    the commit they checkout has a compile error, not sure why
    the most recent sail-riscv master as of writing also doesn't work
        https://github.com/riscv/sail-riscv/issues/333
        https://github.com/riscv/sail-riscv/issues/325
    commit 532714a6c71b47a91176eb90fef3b3b049c52fce builds

at this point bin/wally-tool-chain-install.sh should work. run it.

for some reason some of my submodules were gone at this point, if this happens to you check to make sure all the files weren't accidentally deleted? really weird

* make riscof at some point on make memfiles in /home/user/cvw/tests/riscof/Makefile, which expects extractFunctionRadix.sh in the path. extractFunctionRadix.sh is in cvw/bin, so add that to $PATH

at this point make riscof from cvw root should work

We used https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/software-kit/785113/questa-intel-fpgas-standard-edition-software-version-22-1-2.html for simulation. Follow install instructions.

Running vsim after sourcing setup.sh seems to not work. manually setting $WALLY variable seems to be sufficient to run regression-wally. Do this by
```
cd sim
./regression-wally
```
running the full default thing takes a while, if you see a
rv32gc_wally32priv: Success
type message then it passed a test case so its doing simulation properly. 

Note our comitted version of `regression-wally` only does privilege tests

To simulate a testcase with demonstrating the hardware trojan, run 
```
vsim > logs/troj -c<<!
do wally-troj.do rv64gc wally64troj
!
```
or 
```
vsim > logs/troj -c<<!
do wally-troj.do rv64gc wally64troj2
!
```

Loose instructions for building the memfiles (which we comitted for ease of use)
1) In cvw/tests/riscof run
```
riscof run --work-dir=work2 --config=config64.ini --suite=../wally-riscv-arch-test/troj/ --env=../wally-riscv-arch-test/riscv-test-suite/env --no-clean
```
makes stuff in /home/user/cvw/tests/riscof/work2/rv64i_m/privilege/src/WALLY-troj-01.S/ref
note it fails if work2 exists, so just rm -rf it first

2) run
```
riscv64-unknown-elf-elf2hex --bit-width 64 --input "ref.elf" --output "ref.elf.memfile"
```
to build the memfile, which is what will actually be used by the testbench
run
4) ```
extractFunctionRadix.sh ref.elf.objdump
```
to make debug stuff the testbench wants
4) copy
cp ~/cvw/tests/riscof/work2/rv64i_m/privilege/src/WALLY-troj-01.S . -r
when in ~/cvw/tests/riscof/work/wally-riscv-arch-test/rv64i_m/troj/src



# core-v-wally

Wally is a 5-stage pipelined processor configurable to support all the standard RISC-V options, incluidng RV32/64, A, C, F, D, Q, M, and Zb* extensions, virtual memory, PMP, and the various privileged modes and CSRs. It provides optional caches, branch prediction, and standard RISC-V peripherals (CLINT, PLIC, UART, GPIO).   Wally is written in SystemVerilog.  It passes the RISC-V Arch Tests and boots Linux on an FPGA.  Configurations range from a minimal RV32E core to a fully featured RV64GC application processor.

![Wally block diagram](wallyriscvTopAll.png)

Wally is described in an upcoming textbook, *RISC-V System-on-Chip Design*, by Harris, Stine, Thompson, and Harris.  Users should follow the setup instructions below.  A system administrator must install CAD tools using the directions further down.

# Verification

Wally is presently at Technology Readiness Level 4, passing the RISC-V compatibility test suite and custom tests, and booting Linux in simulation and on an FPGA.  See the [Test Plan](docs/testplans/testplan.md) for details.

# New User Setup

New users may wish to do the following setup to access the server via a GUI and use a text editor.

	Git started with Git configuration and authentication: B.1 (replace with your name and email)
		$ git config --global user.name "Ben Bitdiddle"
		$ git config --global user.email "ben_bitdiddle@wally.edu"
		$ git config --global pull.rebase false
	Optional: Download and install x2go - A.1.1
	Optional: Download and install VSCode - A.4.2
	Optional: Make sure you can log into your server via x2go and via a terminal
		Terminal on Mac, cmd on Windows, xterm on Linux
		See A.1 about ssh -Y login from a terminal

Then clone the repo, source setup,  make the tests and run regression

	If you don't already have a Github account, create one
	In a web browser, visit https://github.com/openhwgroup/cvw
	In the upper right part of the screen, click on Fork
	Create a fork, choosing the owner as your github account and the repository as cvw.
	
	On the Linux computer where you will be working, log in

Clone your fork of the repo and run the setup script. Change <yourgithubid> to your github id. 

	$ cd
	$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/<yourgithubid>/cvw
	$ cd cvw
	$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/openhwgroup/cvw
	$ source ./setup.sh

Add the following lines to your .bashrc or .bash_profile to run the setup script each time you log in.

	if [ -f ~/cvw/setup.sh ]; then
		source ~/cvw/setup.sh
	fi

Edit setup.sh and change the following lines to point to the path and license server for your Siemens Questa and Synopsys Design Compiler installation and license server.  If you only have Questa, you can still simulate but cannot run logic synthesis.

	export MGLS_LICENSE_FILE=1717@solidworks.eng.hmc.edu                # Change this to your Siemens license server
	export SNPSLMD_LICENSE_FILE=27020@zircon.eng.hmc.edu                # Change this to your Synopsys license server
	export QUESTAPATH=/cad/mentor/questa_sim-2021.2_1/questasim/bin     # Change this for your path to Questa
	export SNPSPATH=/cad/synopsys/SYN/bin                               # Change this for your path to Design Compiler

If the tools are not yet installed on your server, follow the Toolchain Installation instructions in the section below.

Build the tests and run a regression simulation with Questa to prove everything is installed.  Building tests will take a while.

	$ make
	$ cd sim
	$ ./regression-wally       (depends on having Questa installed)

# Toolchain Installation (Sys Admin)

This section describes the open source toolchain installation.  The
current version of the toolchain has been tested on Ubuntu and Red
Hat/Rocky 8 Linux.  Ubuntu works more smoothly and is recommended
unless you have a compelling need for RedHat.  

Ubuntu users can install the tools by running

	$ sudo $WALLY/bin/wally-tool-chain-install.sh

See wally-tool-chain-install.sh for a detailed description of each component,
or to issue the commands one at a time to install on the command line.
## Installing EDA Tools

Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools are vital to implementations of System on Chip architectures as well as validating different designs.   Open-source and commercial tools exist for multiple strategies and although the one can spend a lifetime using combinations of different tools, only a small subset of tools is utilized for this text.  The tools are chosen because of their ease in access as well as their repeatability for accomplishing many of the tasks utilized to design Wally.  It is anticipated that additional tools may be documented later after this is text is published to improve use and access.

Siemens Quest is the primary tool utilized for simulating and validating Wally.    For logic synthesis, you will need Synopsys Design Compiler.  Questa and Design Compiler are commercial tools that require an educational or commercial license.  

Note: Some EDA tools utilize LM_LICENSE_FILE for their environmental variable to point to their license server.  Some operating systems may also utilize MGLS_LICENSE_FILE instead, therefore, it is important to read the user manual on the preferred environmental variable required to point to a userâ€™s license file.  Although there are different mechanisms to allow licenses to work, many companies commonly utilize the FlexLM (i.e., Flex-enabled) license server manager that runs off a node locked license.

Although most EDA tools are Linux-friendly, they tend to have issues when not installed on recommended OS flavors.  Both Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux products typically tend to be recommended for installing commercial-based EDA tools and are recommended for utilizing complex simulation and architecture exploration.  Questa can also be installed on Microsoft Windows as well as Mac OS with a Virtual Machine such as Parallels.  

Siemens Questa

Siemens Questa simulates behavioral, RTL and gate-level HDL.  To install Siemens Questa first go to a web browser and navigate to 
https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/ic/questa/simulation/advanced-simulator/.  Click Sign In and log in with your credentials and the product can easily be downloaded and installed.  Some  Windows-based installations also require gcc libraries that are typically provided as a compressed zip download through Siemens.  

Synopsys Design Compiler (DC)

Many commercial synthesis and place and route tools require a common installer.  These installers are provided by the EDA vendor and Synopsys has one called Synopsys Installer.  To use Synopsys Installer, you will need to acquire a license through Synopsys that is typically Called Synopsys Common Licensing (SCL).  Both the Synopsys Installer, license key file, and Design Compiler can all be downloaded through Synopsys Solvnet.  First open a web browser, log into Synsopsy Solvnet, and download the installer and Design Compiler installation files.  Then, install the Installer

	$ firefox &
Navigate to https://solvnet.synopsys.com
Log in with your institutionâ€™s username and password
Click on Downloads, then scroll down to Synopsys Installer
Select the latest version (currently 5.4).  Click Download Here, agree,
Click on SynopsysInstaller_v5.4.run
Return to downloads and also get Design Compiler (synthesis) latest version, and any others you want.
	Click on all parts and the .spf file, then click Download Files near the top
move the SynopsysIntaller into /cad/synopsys/Installer_5.4 with 755 permission for cad, 
move other files into /cad/synopsys/downloads and work as user cad from here on

	$ cd /cad/synopsys/installer_5.4
	$ ./SynopsysInstaller_v5.4.run
	Accept default installation directory
	$ ./installer
	Enter source path as /cad/synopsys/downloads, and installation path as /cad/synopsys
	When prompted, enter your site ID
	Follow prompts

Installer can be utilized in graphical or text-based modes.  It is far easier to use the text-based installation tool.  To install DC, navigate to the location where your downloaded DC files are and type installer.  You should be prompted with questions related to where you wish to have your files installed.  

The Synopsys Installer automatically installs all downloaded product files into a single top-level target directory. You do not need to specify the installation directory for each product. For example, if you specify /import/programs/synopsys as the target directory, your installation directory structure might look like this after installation:

	/import/programs/synopsys/syn/S-2021.06-SP1

Note: Although most parts of Wally, including the software used in this chapter and Questa simulation, will work on most modern Linux platforms, as of 2022, the Synopsys CAD tools for SoC design are only supported on RedHat Enterprise Linux 7.4 or 8 or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) 12 or 15. Moreover, the RISC-V formal specification (sail-riscv) does not build gracefully on RHEL7. 

The Verilog simulation has been tested with Siemens Questa/ModelSim. This package is available to universities worldwide as part of the Design Verification Bundle through the Siemens Academic Partner Program members for $990/year. 

If you want to implement your own version of the chip, your tool and license complexity rises significantly. Logic synthesis uses Synopsys Design Compiler. Placement and routing uses Cadence Innovus. Both Synopsys and Cadence offer their tools at a steep discount to their university program members, but the cost is still several thousand dollars per year. Most research universities with integrated circuit design programs have Siemens, Synopsys, and Cadence licenses. You also need a process design kit (PDK) for a specific integrated circuit technology and its libraries. The open-source Google Skywater 130 nm PDK is sufficient to synthesize the core but lacks memories. Google presently funds some fabrication runs for universities. IMEC and Muse Semiconductor offers full access to multiproject wafer fabrication on the TSMC 28 nm process including logic, I/O, and memory libraries; this involves three non-disclosure agreements. Fabrication costs on the order of $10,000 for a batch of 1 mm2 chips. 

Startups can expect to spend more than $1 million on CAD tools to get a chip to market. Commercial CAD tools are not realistically available to individuals without a university or company connection.
